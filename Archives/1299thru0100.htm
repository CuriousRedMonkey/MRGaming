            The <I>Alpha</I> communication kernel is complete.  A few bugs have populated from it to the server, but 
            these consequences should be squashed very soon.  <I>Alpha</I> testers are once more online.
         </P>
         <P>
            Added an indicator to the HOME page that allows the <I>Alpha</I> tester to know whether the <B>chat</B>
            and <B>game</B> servers are <I>Up</I> or <I>Down</I>.  This is an aid to knowing why a failed connection 
            occurs.

         <P>
            Created a new look and feel for the web site.  New web content will be phased in weekly.
         </P>
         <P>
            The MicroRealities gaming logo was finalized this weekend.  It will continue to be 
            refined and updated until <I>beta</I> begins.
         </P>
         <P>
            The web site art continues to be a challenge.  It appears we will have to put off the fancy stuff 
            for now.
