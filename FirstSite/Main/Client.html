  <br>
  <B>VaPORS</B> stands for "Virtual and Persistent On-line Role-played System", and is an
  acronym for a MicroRealities design.<BR>
  <BR>
  A <b>VaPORS</b> "client application" allows you to play a <b>VaPORS</b> game.  However, it is not
  some rigid view into an on-line game, as we have come to expect.  It has what is called an "open 
  architecture".  This means that you can change your view and control to whatever it is <b>you</b>
  like.  And so, as your gaming needs change so too can your interface into your <b>VaPORS</b> 
  experience.  Note that as a beginning player you probably won't care, or appreciate this feature,
  so it will in no way affect you getting on-line and into the fray.<br>
  <br>
  The "Proof of Concept" client is available for <a href="../Buttons/Downloads.html">download,</a>
  and currently supports:
  <ul>
  <li>Menuing systems that allow the presentation of data in differing formats.
  <li>Support for variable bandwidths and machine speeds, by allowing on/off switches for resource
      consumers.
  <li>Recording of on-line game sessions, regardless of the interface used.
  <li>Replaying of recorded sessions, independent of the interface used in its creation.
  <li>A test recording to ensure the client is functioning properly, and is up-to-date.
  <li>The replacement of existing single-framed "bitmaps" with those of your own making.
  <li>Server completion of incomplete client requests such as when executing a "behavior", "skill", 
      or "habit".
  </ul>  
  A player or professional can "tailor" the client for fun, education, or commerce.  It is also
  possible to "replace" the entire client, using your own cutting-edge and innovative interfaces. 
  In addition, the developer can turn off some or all of the "default" client options.  The intent
  of the open architecture is to foster creativity, cooperation, opportunity, and growth.<br>
  <BR>
  "Registered" interfaces are now being accepted.
  These "Registered" clients will receive detailed object data, to support accurate and complete 
  real-time modeling and animation.  The developers of these interfaces will need to sign some 
  standard agreements [More information will be forthcoming as the standards are formalized].
  Note that during the final stages of "alpha", at least one 3D 1st/3rd person and at least one
  2D 3rd person perspective will be considered for registration.<br>
  <br>
  "Unregistered" interfaces will be supported in open source code forums.  The public can learn
  and enjoy how to modify/create their own <B>VaPORS</B> interfaces.  It is hoped that an 
  synergetic and supportive relationship will exist between the "Registered" and "Unregistered" 
  communities.  The structure of this relationship will become more obvious once forums and 
  products develop.<br>
  <br><ul>
  Note:  Interfaces offering feature-rich editors and automation, which aid in a player's
  "on-line (or off-line) control", are expected to be the big winners.  They should enable a
  player to easily instruct their creature, in the diverse and independent actions of a
  <b>VaPORS</b> life.
  </ul>
  Please note that the current client is formatted as a graphical debugger and not as a consumer product.  
  It is hoped that by leaving it in this detailed format that it will demonstrate some key game
  play features without adding too much confusion.  However, many features were in fact disabled, 
  including some of its reporting structures.  In addition, please bear with the artistically 
  challenged designer (Robert Winkler), who spent less that 8 hours "in total" on the graphics.
  In spite of this fault, hopefully the drawings are sufficient to indicate the features and 
  possibilities available.<br>
  <br>
  The final "default" client will support binary-code alterations in two ways:
  <ul>
  <li>Hook into the existing executable, by replacing the existing window(s) with your own, via DLL(s).
  <li>Create your own executable and call the "Communication" kernel via its DLL.
  </ul>  
  There are plans to make the kernel available as a <a href="http://www.borland.com/">
  Borland</a> "Component".  Therefore, Borland's Delphi, C++Builder, and JBuilder users will have an 
  even easier time developing and testing their code.  If it is possible to do something similar
  for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/"> Microsoft Visual Studio</a> developers
  then it will be.<br>
