  <BR>
  <B>VaPORS</B> stands for "Virtual and Persistent On-line Role-played System", and is an
  acronym for a MicroRealities design.<BR>
  <BR>
    In a <B>VaPORS</B> game every object can be created, modified, and interacted with by an 
    "in game" creature.  For example, even the smallest pebble of sand can be picked up, engraved
    upon, painted, enchanted, and so on.  This also applies to any of the abstract objects.  For
    example, a language like "Common" can exist because some historical "in game" linguist created
    it, taught it to others who in turn eventually taught it to you, and now your creature can 
    mangle it, teach it, create incantations that use it, etc.  These, and other like features, 
    are what you might hope for from a true virtual world.<br>
    <br>
    But <B>VaPORS</B> is about more than that, because it is truly role-played.  Everything a 
    player chooses to do is actually "acted out" by their creature.  This is done by creating a 
    series of "habits" in a creature.  For example, regardless of whether a player is being active
    (like attacking, talking, creating,...) or is being passive (like witnessing a murder, 
    examining objects, researching a new skill,...), it is their creature that is actually "doing 
    the living".  And so, as a player plays the game, they are teaching their creature about 
    itself; it begins to come alive, by acting willfully consistent and "in character".<br>
  <br>
  Some standards inherit to all <B>VaPORS</B> games:<ul>
<li><b>Reality</b><ul>
       <li>As stated above, all things are available for creation, modification, and interaction.
           This includes abstract realities like creating a new weapon, improving the method of
           prayer, researching magics by gesture, etc.
       <li>Creatures reproduce, and interact with their environments, and so are not "just 
           generated" because of some timing/#of thresholds.
       <li>Creatures are multi-action organisms, and so can walk and chew bubble-gum at the same
           time.(g)</ul>
<li><b>Depth </b><ul>
       <li>All creatures have unique body parts, skills, behaviors, experiences, relations, histories, etc.
       <li>All quests are created by creatures, whether they are computer generated or controlled 
           by players.  So if you create, or are offered, a quest think about the consequences as 
           if it were real, because it has "in game" effects.
       <li>The diversity of objects (inanimates, animates, abstracts, etc.) and their descriptors
           are unlimited.  What a server can handle will limit the number of instantiations,
           but from a player's perspective there are no constraints on what they can do, become,
           create, explore, discover, etc.</ul>
<li><b>Consistency</b><ul>
       <li>Living and non-living objects behave/interact as you would expect of a "real" object.
       <li>If you act a certain way over and over, then your creature will begin to act that way
           habitually; until you finally break them of the habit.</ul>
<li><b>Abstraction</b><ul>
       <li>"In game" classes, guilds, villages, etc. are created by creatures based on "their 
           own" requirements, skills, contracts, etc.
       <li>If a methodology or technology does not exist then just research it "in game",
           and eventually it will come into existence; especially with others working in concert 
           with that goal (a society).
       <li>Many creatures are non-violent social animals, and so too are the roles many players
           will want to play.  This leads to a gaming experience that can be solely social 
           but equally deep.</ul>
<li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b><ul>
       <li>All organisms and communities learn from mistakes and successes.  
       <li>Organisms adapt based on similar concepts to "natural selection".  
       <li>Intellegent creatures experiment, and train their offspring, based on their successes.  
           So don't expect dumb races to stay dumb, if they are going to survive.</ul>
</ul>
(This barely scratches the surface of a <B>VaPORS</B> game, but should give you a clue as to 
the game play)<br>
