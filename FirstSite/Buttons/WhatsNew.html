  <ul>
     <li> [11/29/99] <P>
       The rewrite of the communication kernel has begun again. [Expect a few weeks.]<br>
       The web site changes did not occur.  The art is not quite ready. [Expect next week.]<P>
     <li> [11/22/99] <P>
       Testers, and users of the chat program, can now login to MicroRealities using "LogIn.MrGaming.com".<br>
       The rewrite of the communication kernel was postponed for another week.  Instead attention was focused upon the 
         web site. [Expect the rewrite to begin next week.]<br>
       The web site's look, structure, and content will change next week, and will continue re-construction over the coming 
         weeks.<br>
       No new Interns are being considered.  There is a lot of new talent up and coming.  Thank you all who applied.<br>
       Internship meetings have increased in frequency from once a month to once a week.</P>
     <li> [11/17/99] <P>
       The 24x7 digital link to the Internet is installed and functioning.<br>
       "www.MrGaming.com" is the official site for "MicroRealities Gaming" web content.<br>
       Testers will soon use, "login.MrGaming.com", instead of an IP address to connect. 
         [Expect sub-domain installation within the next 7 days.]<br>
       The first Internship meeting went well, with the only hiccup being that it lastly longer than originally intended.
         Welcome new Interns: Daniel Fordyce and Grace Kim.<br>       
       Three new alpha testers have joined our team.  Welcome new ATT members: Ravaillac, Cobra, and Mordecai.<br>
       "www.MrGaming.com"'s look and content will change in the coming weeks, so please send us 
       <A HREF="mailto:webcontact@mrgaming.com"> feedback</A> on your likes, dislikes, and suggestions.</P>
     <li> [11/04/99] <P>
       The number of Internship requests has been staggering.  Finalists have been notified by email. [First meeting in 
         two weeks.]<br>
       The rewrite of the communication kernel, for the alpha specifications, was slowed because of so many Internship 
         interviews.  Now that the Technical Internships have closed, the major focus will return to the communication 
         kernel rewrite. [Testers can expect to logon once more, starting Jan. 1, 2000.]<br>
       Interviews and selections for the Arts Internships and Business Internships will also close soon.<br>
       There are a few Alpha Tester Finalists who have not completed there kits.  Please reread your kits thoroughly, and
         if something is not clear then email me rather than spin your wheels.<br>
       The installation of the digital line appears to be on schedule.  [Installation is expected in 4 weeks.]</P>
     <li> [10/13/99] <P>
       The domain name, "MrGaming.com", was purchased and registered. [When the new digitial line is installed (7 weeks), 
         this web site's URL will change.  Soon after that, testers will no longer need to supply an IP address.]<br>
       Ten "intern positions" were made available and posted on the student's 
         <a href="http://www.jobtrack.com/">JobTrak</a> network.</P>
     <li> [10/07/99] <P>
       A 24x7 digital link to the internet was leased today.  The new bandwidth is 5x our current bandwidth. 
         [Installation estimate is 8 weeks.]<br>
       "Alpha Tester Submission Kits" are now available from either the 
         "<a href="../Tabs/Testers.html">Testers</a>" or 
         "<a href="Downloads.html">Downloads</a>" pages.<br>
       Pre-alpha testers, and previous alpha requesters, should now have their kits.</P>
     <li> [9/23/99] <P>
       The "alpha" phase begins. [Testers will receive their kits by email in a few weeks.]<br>
       The communication kernel is being upgraded to the "alpha" specifications. [Expect over a month of downtime.]<br>
       The design document for the behavior "research" is complete.  This allows a player to develop new skills,
       experiences, or perceptions "upon demand".  The focus of a player's research is guaranteed to be a "logical 
       consequence" of their inputted parameters.  For now, only "passive" research is supported. [A more informative
       post will exist when implementation is completed.]</P>
     <li> [8/23/99] <P>
       Character "experiences" now affect reporting mechanisms as well as "in game" interactions.  This means that every
       life form, including player creatures, will perceive their world uniquely.  An example, would be three creatures
       (a magic user, a weapon maker, and a wood carver) looking at a wooden staff.  All will see common information that
       allows them to recognize and interact with the staff.  However, the first creature would recognize that the
       staff has magical properties, the second would know detailed things inherent in its use as a weapon,
       and the third would recognize information like where the wood came from and things about the engraver.  Their 
       unique knowledge will allow them to uniquely alter/use the staff for potentials the other two are unaware.
       The client's application receives character experiences under the "form", "material", and "stats" windows 
       of the current player application.</P>
     <li> [7/23/99] <P>
       Time and aging now exist world wide.<br>
       All living organisms, including their body parts, age within the context of their life span (ex: Very old 
       organisms will suffer the logical consequences of the aging process like increased frequency of organ 
       failure or the slow dwindling of muscle mass).<br>
       "Composite" creation/destruction is functioning (ex: New creature births have complete anatomies(feet,brain,etc.), 
       seriously damaged vital organs will cause the organism's death, seriously damaged non-vitals(hands,legs,etc.) will 
       decay independently of the organism).<br>
       Concepts of decay, decomposition, and reconstitution now exist for all items(living and non-living).</P>
    <li> [5/17/99] <P>
       Some personal issues needed addressing these last couple months and now development will continue.<br>
       Added a "Stay On Top" to the chat program, because it was trivial and requested by many people.<br>
       [Note:  The "Chat" program was/is a learning tool, and so its code will eventually be made public.]<br>
       Decided not to attend the E3 Conference this year, and will continue to fund the project internally.<br>
       Creature birth, aging, death, and offspring are the current focus. [Expect moderate updates]</P>
    <li> [3/24/99] <P>
       Setting up some business administration: CPA, Lawyers, Game Agent, E3 Conference, etc.</P>
    <li> [3/4/99] <P>
       Changed the format of the "About" page, so that Netscape and IE browsers display it the same.<br>
       Refocusing development time back onto final "proof of concept" issues. [Expect sparse updates]</P>
    <li> [3/3/99] <P>
       Created the <a href="GetInvolved.html">Getting Involved</a>" page.<BR>
       Changed the "Self" screen shot (mouse focus is on a partially constructed human being head, 
       and so there are only two eyes and a mouth shown in the construction area).</P>
    <li> [3/2/99] <P>
       Added some pre-alpha screen shots to the home page.<BR>
       Created the <a href="../Tabs/About.html">About</a>" page.</P>
    <li> [3/1/99] <P>
       Created the <a href="../Tabs/Investors.html">Investors, Advertisers</a>" page.<BR>

    <li> [2/26/99] <P>

    <li> [2/25/99] <P>
       Created the <b>MicroRealities Gaming</b> website.</P>
