         Can software really exist that allows for an unlimited number of skills, classes, spells, and so on?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Yes.&nbsp; It is possible because of the new approach MicroRealities has taken to gaming - Virtual Reality
             Environments (VREs).&nbsp; To learn more about VREs visit the "Misc." page, and click on "The Idea" and 
             "The Engine".
            <BR><BR>
            "The Engine" and a small private game have been running for over a year now.&nbsp; So, this is not just a 
             theory, but actual software (a working game) which demonstrates that the "unlimited" nature of things
             works quite well.

         Is game play graphical, or is it text based like in a MUD?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Graphical.&nbsp; As you would expect - click and kill, drag/drop and trade, drag/drop and construct, etc.
            <BR><BR>
            However, the engine was designed 'interface blind', meaning any type of interface can be used.&nbsp; 
             This will allow future freedom and opportunity, for both game players and developers, only hinted at so
             far.

         Will PvP and PKing be allowed?  And if so, under what circumstances?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Yes, PvP (Player versus Player) and PKing (Player Killing) will be allowed under certain circumstances.&nbsp;
            However, it is the intent of MicroRealities to create online experiences that allow all players to
             have fun, but not at the expense of others.
            <BR><BR>
            There is nothing inherent in VREs and Vapors (see "The Idea" and "The Engine") about PvP and PKing.&nbsp; 
             From the engine's point of view, a PC (player character) is just another creature in the game, with no more
             consideration than any other life-form.&nbsp; However, it will be up to the game designer to decide 
             where and how, and even if, PvP/PKing will be allowed in their game.&nbsp;
            <BR><BR>
            In Pravos, the first game to be released by MicroRealities, PvP and PKing will be supported within the
             context of "in game" logic.&nbsp; Namely, if you 'feud' with another family, guild, or city there must
             be a 'documented' reason for it (proof that they killed a family member, philosophical conflicts found in 
             guild charters, contested resources necessary for the survival and prosperity of a group, and so forth).&nbsp; 
             These are all "in game", not player personal, reasons.
            <BR><BR>
            In Pravos, there will be areas of obvious PvP and PKing possibilities.&nbsp; These will be arenas, tournaments,
             training pits, your home, your guildhall, your lands, and so on.&nbsp; There will also be the 'Uncivilized  
             Lands', which will require that you solve some of the "Grand Quests", for access.&nbsp; These later areas
             are for intermediate and advanced characters, and the story line will make it very obvious why PvP and PKing
             will be allowed.&nbsp; Also note that "in game" events will be held to test players against each other, for
             prizes, for notoriety, and for future contracts.
            <BR><BR>
            So, in Pravos, the bottom line is that you will not 'player kill' just for killing sake, but will have an
             "in game" reason for it.&nbsp; And yes, MicroRealities will punish and possibly ban players who abuse 
             this point, when PKing in the Pravos game.

         I am wondering about death piles.  Can anyone loot the items from creatures I have killed?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Yes.&nbsp; There is no compelling reason to create contrived code to handle this issue.&nbsp; Here is why...
         <BR><BR>
         In all previous online fantasy games, it is some "out of game" entity that is creating all those rare magic 
          items, which you must get from your kills before someone else does.
         <BR><BR>
         This is not the case, in Pravos, our fantasy game.&nbsp; 
          Every item that exists in the game, was created by an "in game" creature.&nbsp; 
          Which means that you do not need to stress over grabbing the special item, but can create the item 
          <b>yourself</b>, commission it, enslave the creature that created it, or many other methods of getting it.&nbsp; 
          <i>[Note the <b>only</b> exception to the "in game" rule may be the few "Grand Quest" items, which are 
          useless for personal survival issues.&nbsp; This is still to be decided.]</i>
         <BR><BR>
         Probably, the only other main reason why someone would require that the corpse be protected, is for "coin" 
         value and what that represents.&nbsp; As in other games, Pravos also uses "coins" as the life blood of 
         civilization.&nbsp; So, even though someone else may loot your kill, and rob you of some time and resources, 
         it is not enough of a motivation to create some special contrived code that will end up producing other problems.
         <BR><BR>
         One other important, and loosely related, point...&nbsp; Just because someone else does a quick search of a body, 
          doesn't mean that they found all there is to be found.&nbsp; 
          Searching through pockets, discovering a hidden seam, finding a coin tucked under a 
          headband, all take time, skill, and perception.&nbsp; And sometimes, even magic, to see past an illusion.

         How is death handled?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         There are many ways to come back from a death - it need not be permanent.  Death will be handled in conventional 
         ways, and new ways.<BR><BR>

         Players can create their own resurrection approaches (see "The Engine"), or use the standards that the "Game
         Designer" specified for the game - i.e. a special spell, a prayer sung by the survivors, electro-shock 
         paddles, and so forth.  However, if you are not resurrected, you can be reborn into either a new character (see 
         the "Creatures" FAQs") or into one of your "special relationship" characters - e.g. your progeny, your vassals, 
         or any other guardianship non-player character.<BR><BR>
       
         In fact, if you like, you need not have a body at all - play as a spirit or ghost.  Be aware of the fact, that the 
         longer you exist as only a spirit the more you will forget of your current life (or your previous life).  In other 
         words, things like skills, experiences, relationships, and other characteristics will begin to drop away until 
         they cease to have meaning, or even exist, for you.<BR><BR>

         Take note of the issue, that all computer controlled creatures in the game are on an even playing field.  This 
         means that many can create their own rituals of resurrection, resuscitation, and rebirth.  They will adapt to
         environmental, social, and other extraordinary pressures.

         How is game balance handled?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Issues of game balance are handled very differently than in other games (see "Items" FAQs).  Because there
            are no hard-coded "classes", infinite spawns of monsters, experience level to kill ratio, and so on, it 
            allows a very different set of design equations to address the issues of game balance.  This fundamental change
            is the key to unlocking MicroRealities games.
            <BR><BR>
            The simplest answer would be to say that since all actions require energy, and energy is neither created nor 
            destroyed, then what each creature can do is inherently balanced.  This applies to sword swings, magic spells,
            creating items, reproduction, and so on.

         I read that magic can have side-effects.  Can you go into a little more detail about this?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            You can think of magic as radioactive particles.  The more powerful the magic the more exposure you 
            receive.  Magic practitioners rarely worry about it these days, because the effects are treatable or 
            "interesting".
            <BR><BR>
            Discovering the what, why, and how of "The Great Joining", is part of the story line of the "Pravos" 
            game.  So, not much  will be said about it, except:
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <i>It is written that the magic released was so powerful that Mankind was forever changed, and that is 
                when the "Races of Man", the "Hybrids", and the "Eternals" appeared.</i> (see "Creatures" FAQs)
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
            As you uncover what is true and what is a fable, you will unlock how magic works, and therefore come to
            understand and use the side-effects of it to your advantage.

         I have read that all characters have body parts.  Can you chop off an enemy's arm and then beat them with it?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Yes.  In all games, the loss of a limb is not considered critical to remaining alive.  It will probably result in
         a loss of consciousness though.  Be aware of the fact, that if their arm is reattached, it is possible that it
         can function perfectly once more - depending on how much time has passed, the type of procedure, skill of the 
         practitioner, and so on.  As you would expect, some body parts are required to sustain life.  So, the loss of 
         their head or heart would probably mean their death, but the loss of their right or left eye would probably not.

         How many active characters can I have per account? Will I be limited to one, or can I have many?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         These points have not been decided yet.
         <BR><BR>
         However, it may be fine that you have only one character per account.&nbsp; The reason is because your 
          character is not restricted to any one class of skills, can hire many NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to assist in 
          its travels and quests, and a few other issues beyond the scope of the FAQs, all of which will allow you to focus 
          your efforts and notoriety into a single persona.
         <BR><BR>
         The current plan though, is to allow a player to bring in any of their single charactered accounts, into a single 
          "partied" session (your own personal gang, family, clan, etc.) defined by their "in game" relationships.&nbsp; 
          But this will be decided in BETA.

         How much will MicroRealities charge for "Pravos"?

      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         When Pravos enters "public BETA", that decision will be made.
         <BR><BR>
         However, the current plan is to have
          you purchase the GUI (Graphical User Interface) application from a separate developer, be charged a monthly fee 
          by MicroRealities for each account that accesses Pravos, with each additional account receiving a discount.
