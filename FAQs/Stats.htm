         What types of stats can I expect to see in the games?

            Currently, players <i>begin</i> with the "familiar five" - Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and 
             Strength.&nbsp;
            <BR><BR>
            It is important to realize that other common stats like, "Charisma", "Willpower", and "Luck", will also be
             seen by the beginning player, but these are all your character's personal perceptions of reality, not the 
             actual values used by the game engine.&nbsp;
            This is similar to real life, where many properties come together to create complex statistics like
             Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.&nbsp;
            <BR><BR>
            Currently, some smithy-type characters have developed unique stats such as, "hardness", "brittleness", and 
             "malleability".&nbsp; Other "classes" have created unique stats too, but the list quickly becomes specialized.
            <BR><BR>
            If you want to create '<i>non-existent</i>' stats like "Gracefulness" or "Jiggy Factor" then <b>you</b> must 
             define it, research it, and finally put a name to it - <b>all within the game</b>.&nbsp; 
            If you want to learn an '<i>existing</i>' stat, that was created by another player (or computer controlled 
             character), then you must have them teach it to you.&nbsp;
            Note, that they value their knowledge and so may not wish to teach it to you until you give them a fair
             exchange:&nbsp; Complete a quest, pay them, teach them something new, and so on.
            <BR><BR>
            Once the BETA begins, a private game is played to "develop" your character, and it is then that you can add 
             to your list of starting perceptions.&nbsp;
            The underlying properties (the actual stats) look nothing like what you are familiar with in current games -
             they are abstract properties that are more common to physics, economics, sociology, and so on.&nbsp;
            There are currently over one million possible stats, with a theoretical limit of two billion.

         What types of stats should I work on, in the fantasy game "Pravos"?

         Like in real life, regular exercise, a healthy diet, learning new things, are all valuable and will improve your 
         statistics.&nbsp; 
         So, in the game, do things as you would in real life that keep you healthy and happy.&nbsp; 
         Also, you should think about the type of character you are playing and then do those things which are
         beneficial to that aim.
         <BR><BR>
         For instance, players that play non-violent characters will be merchants, rulers, artisans, etc.&nbsp;
         Merchant-types want to develop their abilities in judging product value, increase their chances to detect 
          deception, and so on.&nbsp;
         Rulers and artisans might wish to increase some of these stats too, but they will want to develop ones that 
          aid them in <b>their</b> unique game-play.  
         <BR><BR>
         Likewise, the violent characters like warriors, thieves, mages, and so on, would want to develop very unique 
          stat perceptions.&nbsp;
         Warriors would want to judge weapon quality, armor strengths, adversary techniques, and so forth.&nbsp;
         Whereas, mages would want to judge intrinsic magical value, magical resistences, magic capacity, etc.
