         Yes.&nbsp; This does not mean that they are good at teaching the new skill though, nor can they teach much on the

         Will there be any assigned skills (or abilities) that a player can choose from during the phase he/she is creating 
          his character?

         Yes.

         Know that you are born into an actual race, family, and community.&nbsp; 
          "Genetic abilities" are inherent, so concerning these, there is nothing for you to choose from.&nbsp; 
          However, you can pick, choose, and pursue "learned skills" during the creation process.&nbsp; 
          It is your family and community which offers to teach you learnable skills, during your PRIVATE game play 
          (character creation).
         <BR><BR>
         What you choose, how long you take to learn it, and how many different skills you wish to start with, all are 
          choices you will make during your pre-PUBLIC appearance.

         Since there are no hard-coded classes, how do I train?

      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Approach a player, or computer controlled character, and contract for some training.&nbsp; You may haggle,
            trade items, trade training, or use any number of ways to set a price, before contracting for the 
            training.&nbsp;
            Depending on the agreement and skills to be trained, it can take seconds or years.
            <BR><BR>
            Most players join a "Class" to <i>initially</i> pursue specific skills.&nbsp; This means they will want
            to do most of their practicing, training, and learning within their guild hall.&nbsp; That is "one of" the main 
            reasons you created/joined that particular guild - to get great prices and learn skills unavailable outside of
            it.
            <BR><BR>
            Once your guild is established, you are going to want to hire NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to research,
            study, practice, and train in your specialties.&nbsp; Your guild will fund these NPCs through its member's
            tithes, costs for training, guild merchandise and services, or any other way you can financially support
            and/or attract other highly skilled NPCs.
<!-- Unnecessary?            <BR><BR>
            Let's say, your guild is a "Healer" type of class, then you will have guild NPCs and PCs (other 
            Player Characters) who will be highly skilled in the healing arts (prayers, spells, herbs, etc.).&nbsp;
            These specialized skills are likely be related to "only healing", so no other non-Healer guild will 
            have spent the time practicing, learning, and teaching these healing arts.&nbsp; Maybe your guild only heals 
            Elves, so they are even further specialized, and shall exceed all others in the time spent healing Elves. -->

         In all games I have played, skill gain soon becomes tedious and boring.  How will skill gain be handled in your
          games?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            The "Skills" themselves, and therefore the skill gains, have been designed in a completely novel way.&nbsp; 
             We have addressed two reasons why so many online games feel like
            <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' 
             TITLE='Work in the sense of, mind numbing activities that are tedious and repetitive.'>
              "work"</SPAN>.&nbsp;
            <BR><BR>
            The first part has to do with how skills are constructed.&nbsp; 
            In all MicroRealities games, just consider skills as building blocks, much like "molecules" being built from 
             "atoms".
            <BR><BR>
            "Atomic" skills would be the most basic types, like 'Jump', 'Kick', 'Run', 'Bash', 'Swing', and so on.&nbsp; 
            "Molecular" skills are built up from the "Atomic" and other "Molecular" skills, so things like 'Charge' (a 
             running bash), 'Jumpkick' (a run, jump, and kick), and so on require no additional coding once their component 
             parts exist in a game.&nbsp; In other words, players and NPCs have available to them a breadth of potential 
             skills that is truly staggering.
            <BR><BR>
            Obviously, there is more to the construction process.&nbsp; Also, there are "Complex" skills such as,
             'Berserking', 'Morphing', and their like.&nbsp; But, thinking of skills as "Molecules" will always steer you 
             well in a MicroRealities game.
            <BR><BR>
            When you practice/use a skill, not only will that skill be increased but so too its building blocks.&nbsp;
             As you would expect, using 'Jumpkick' should have some positive effect on your ability to 'Jump' and to 
             'Kick'.&nbsp; As well, it should improve "parallel skills" like, 'Jumpstrike', because they share common
             actions.&nbsp; How the increases are implemented will not be discussed, but left to the players to learn and 
             exploit for their survival.
            <BR><BR>
            The second part of the reason so many online games feel like "work",
              is because you <b>cannot</b> gain a new ability unless you reach a certain skill level.&nbsp; 
             In other words, only through gaining skill 15 in 'shortsword' would you be allowed to 'charge', 
             'multi-strike', etc.
            <BR><BR>
            This does not happen in a Vapors game, unless
            <BR><BR>
            <OL>
               <LI>The game designer "artificially" places a restriction on the scenario. <i>[I expect this case to
                   be very rare, especially once designers experience the game balances inherent in the Vapors engine.]</i>
               </LI>
               <BR><BR>
               <LI><i>[The more likely case will be that,]</i> An "in game" trainer or social order (guild, school, etc.)
                   has as part of its "charter", a restriction on advancement or training. (see "Classes" FAQs)&nbsp;
                   But this in no way stops you from independently developing the skill 'charge' and 'multi-strike' on your
                   own!
               </LI>
            </OL>
            <BR>
            Now with all this said, if you wish to mindless go where you have gone so often before, you are free to do
             so.&nbsp; However, once your advancement slows in one skill (to the point of boredom), just 'practice' or 
             'power skill' in some other related ability and you will reap benefits in all of your component/parallel 
             skills.

         I am not sure I understand the difference between a "behavior" and a "skill".  Can you explain the difference?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Essentially, a "behavior" is <b>what</b> you want to do, and a "skill" is <b>how</b> you want to do it.
            <BR><BR>
            Behaviors like "perceive" and "move" are abstract actions, common to all animals.&nbsp;
            However, not all animals solve their perception and movement problems in the same way - this is where skills 
             come in.&nbsp;
            For instance, a dolphin can perceive with its sonic skill, and it can move using its swim skill - a snail 
             cannot (it perceives and moves using very different skills).
            <BR><BR>
            Another difference is that behaviors come with the organism's genetic material.&nbsp; 
            In other words, they are genetically programmed to be able to process and solve certain types of problems.
             &nbsp;
            Therefore, you can't have a snail create furniture for you unless <b>you</b> change it into a totally different
             creature.&nbsp;
            There are a few quantum evolutionary steps that will always separate one species from another, no matter how 
             many magics, grafts, and skills are applied.

         I read something about the "form" of a body part and how it determines whether a skill can still be used.

            If your legs were turned into a tail, should you still be able to walk?&nbsp;
            No.&nbsp;
            You still have the ability to move (a behavior) and have all those years of walking (a skill) built up, but 
             you no longer have the physical equipment (a form) necessary to do the deed.

         Does "power level" affect your behaviors differently than it does your skills?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            Yes, but only in the AI's (Artificial Intelligence's) choice of which skill to choose.
            <BR><BR> 
            For example, if you choose the "move" behavior and set its power level to the 
            <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' TITLE='Power levels range from 1 (the minimum) to 10 (the maximum).'>
               maximum</SPAN>, 
             then most likely your creature will use one of its "acceleration" skills, not one of its "velocity" 
             skills.&nbsp;
            "Acceleration" skills are things like running, flying, and tumbling, where it takes time to accelerate to some
             high speed.&nbsp;
            "Velocity" skills are things like walking, gliding, and crawling, which take little time to achieve a constant 
             speed.
            <BR><BR>
            There are a lot of factors that go into AI choices for which of your skills should be used.&nbsp;
            For example, at a maximum power level, you will likely sprint (run) if you are upright, on an even surface, 
             have the energy to begin the sprint, and so forth.&nbsp; 
            Note though, if <b>you</b> explicitly choose "walk", at max power, then walking will be attempted.&nbsp;
            You will not be running, but would be power-walking, which has a different maximum speed, energy consumption
             rate, and so on.
            <BR><BR>
            Be aware that, as in real life, running is very different than walking.&nbsp;
            When running, you cannot "stop on a dime", immediately pivot 90 degrees in a new direction, and so forth.&nbsp;
            All physical skills are based on the laws of mechanical and Newtonian physics.
