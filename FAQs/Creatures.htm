         What types of creatures will exist in the fantasy game?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Approximately one hundred species will exist when the game is released.&nbsp;
         They can be classified into three main 
         groups:
         <!-- Netscape will not show bubble help for the SPAN element so use {} in STYLE so only IE shows the green -->
         <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' TITLE='Any creature that can reason abstractly and produce artifacts'>
            <b>Tool Users</b></SPAN>, 
         <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' TITLE='Any creature that owes its existence to magic'>
            <b>Innately Magical</b></SPAN>, and
         <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' TITLE='Any life that is believed to be without self-consciousness'>
            <b>Primatives</b></SPAN>.

         <BR><BR>

         A third of the <b>Tool Users</b> are the "Races of Man" (Human, Dwarf, Elf, ...).&nbsp;
         Another third contain the "Hybrids" (Half-Dwarves, Dark Elves, ...).&nbsp;
         The remaining third are the "Eternals" (Dragons, Giants, Fiends, ...).&nbsp;
          "Eternals" will eventually have races too (The "Races of Dragons" will include AirDragons, StoneDragons,
          SeaDragons, ...), soon after the game is released.

         <BR><BR> 

         The <b>Innately Magical</b> group are Lycanthropes, Golems, Ents, and others such creatures.&nbsp;
         A few months after the release of the game, expect to see new races of these creatures appear too, like the "Races 
          of Lycanthropes" (Werewolves, Werelions, Werebears, ...), the "Races of Ents" (Proors, Anitto, Muurs, ...), 
          and so on.&nbsp;
         Note that even though most of the magical creatures are wise, complex, and able to create tools, they are 
          primarily distinguished by the fact that they would not exist but for magic.

         <BR><BR>

         The largest group of creatures are the <b>Primatives</b>.&nbsp;
         This group has some very intelligent members, but they are primarily recognized as life-forms who are unable to 
          use or make tools.&nbsp;
         Domestication of some of these entities has met with success, however most of them remain wild.&nbsp;
         You will see many familiar species like Canines, Felines, Equines, Birds, Insects, Lizards, Fish, Mollusks, Trees, 
          Bushes, and Roots, but you will also see many fanciful creations.

         <BR><BR>

         It is rumored that some of the 
         <SPAN STYLE='{color:#5AB542}' TITLE='The alpha testers'> 
            players</SPAN> have begun producing new species, which are horrible mis-shaped things doing the evil bidding 
         of their creators.

         How do I create my own creature/character?
         </FONT>
      </DT>

         <P>
         Essentially, you get to choose from a list of recent births and then mold the character into the creature you wish 
         it to be.&nbsp;
         These characters exist within a species, community, family, and so on.&nbsp;
         Therefore, your character will have an immediate game context, have relationships and lineage, etc.

         <BR><BR>

         Once you have chosen your character, you will play a short private game.&nbsp;
         This will allow you to define yourself through choices and game play actions.&nbsp;
         This begins the process of making your character completely unique.&nbsp;
         You can stop the private game at any time and start playing in the public game at any stage of development.&nbsp;
         For example, a character that is stopped in its development at the age of 5, is guaranteed to be consistent with 
          other 5 year olds in its species, community, technology, and so forth.&nbsp;
         The same applies for a 100 year old creature.
