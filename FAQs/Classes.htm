          The issue of "Player Classes" brings to mind a question about suffering from skill-boredom. By this I mean, 
           am I going to be standing in some building with a stick beating on a dummy for 2 weeks, before I can hunt? 
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         No.&nbsp; You can hunt immediately.&nbsp; Remember (see "Characters" FAQs), when you first roll-up a character, 
          you are going to play a short PRIVATE game.&nbsp; If YOU want to mold your character from birth as a fighter,
          hunter, or whatever, then you can immediately seek conflict, because you will have years of specific training at 
          your disposable.
         <BR><BR>
         Also note that repeated training is important to your future.&nbsp; So, yes you can train with a Guild Master (or 
          beat on a dummy) for a couple weeks to boost your skills further.&nbsp; And, this will not be as boring and 
          tedious as you might think, because your character can be doing other things at the same time.&nbsp; As stated on 
          the web page, "The Engine", your character will have "Independent and logical action:&nbsp; Walk, talk, juggle, 
          and think all concurrently".&nbsp; Here is how to relieve the boredom... 
         <BR><BR>
         Something new to MicroRealities games are things called, "Habits".&nbsp; These allow you to automate many things 
          your character does, like when training, practicing, teaching, or any other repetitive action.&nbsp; This means 
          in the case of training, you can carry on a relaxed conversation with someone else while going through your 
          "forms", or if your habitual training requires less attention/intensity then read through your latest scroll, 
          "Drowning: How to avoid it, using Magical Runes" at the same time.

         In "Pravos", can I create (or pay for) special guild features, like a fountain that cures all diseases or an altar 
         that enchants any wood item to a +1 stat/combat/etc.?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Yes.&nbsp; You can either create it yourself "in game", or pay "out of game" for inner guild hall features.&nbsp; 
          However, the details of these "out of game" extras will not be discussed until Pravos enters public BETA.
         <BR><BR>
         Actually, your question has hit on one of the main differences between prayer and magic.&nbsp; "In general", 
          prayers invoke power from a higher source, and magic focuses your/local energies as the source.&nbsp; So the 
          praying character, at low skill level, would have a better chance of creating the fountain or altar you 
          mentioned.&nbsp; However, once a magic-user becomes highly skilled, they would know how to accomplish it just as 
          easily.&nbsp; This is not a "rule" about prayers and magic, only a hint at the difference - the source of the 
          "real" power.
         <BR><BR>
         And remember (see "Stats" FAQs) that "+1" is a very subjective thing in a Vapors game.&nbsp; In addition, keep
          in mind that it is <b>you</b> who defines a stat, combat add, defensive add, etc.&nbsp; It is true that these
          things exist in a "raw physics form" and so when you create a perception for a stat, combat, and so on, you will
          be seeing a consistent and realistic representation of <b>your</b> perception.

         I am thinking about creating some type of "Naturalist/Guardian" class, in the game "Pravos". Can I lay claim to a 
         portion of undeveloped land and then create a guild hall out of the natural materials at hand? 
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Yes.&nbsp; However, there is a distinction between 'undeveloped' and 'unclaimed' land.
         <BR><BR>
         For now, you must <i><b>own</b></i> the 'undeveloped' land before you may build a guild hall upon it.&nbsp; 
         This restriction might be loosened to a <i><b>lease</b></i>, which applies to any 'normal building', but that is 
         doubtful.&nbsp; In the case of 'unclaimed' land, the issue of staking/claiming new lands will not be worked out 
         until Pravos enters BETA.&nbsp; So, for now, consider all lands initially deeded to the nearest city and you must 
         purchase, steal, or somehow receive ownership before construction should begin.
         <BR><BR>
         Your biggest hurdle will be to create a guild hall that will endure.&nbsp; One that can weather
         the local environment, ensure that wandering creatures cannot destroy it, and so forth.&nbsp; When you create a 
         structure far from civilization, you will either know how to, or will hire someone else to, build and maintain 
         your place.&nbsp; This ensures that your guild truly represents you, for when future visitor's arrive.&nbsp; 
         In addition, you are probably 
         going to invest a lot of resources on special inner-guild features that will allow your members unique boosts, 
         training, etc., so you don't want to have a place that any old thief can get into, any contending guild can just 
         puff and blow your walls down, and so on.
         <BR><BR>
         You might build your guild hall from the 'materials at hand' in a conventional sense - stone walls, wood roof, 
         etc. - or use unconventional practices.&nbsp; 
         For instance, let's imagine that you wanted to "grow" your guild hall from a circle of trees.&nbsp;
         Your imagination and your character's skill-set is the only limit - 'catwalks', guild rooms in the tree tops,
         magic sap for rejuvenation, and so on.&nbsp; It will take time to grow all these things, even if you are a 
         "master" magician (or whatever).&nbsp; So you see, as long as the guild hall is 
         <i>recognizable as "your permanent" meeting place</i> and has moderate protection, then a 
         conventional or unconventional construction will be approved as a "guild hall".
         <BR><BR>
         One other issue that you should be considering.&nbsp; If your guild hall ends up within the protection of a
         community (town, city, etc.), then you will probably be paying taxes to them for the land, protection, or
         whatever services they supply.&nbsp; So, this means you should consider setting up some guild merchant NPCs
         (Non-Player Characters) to create, improve, or teach things to generate <b>income for the guild</b>.

         As long as you meet the requirements of each guild (class) then join as many as will accept you. (see the "How do 
          I create a class?" question below)
         <BR><BR>
         However, if one of your guilds has a "charter" conflict with another guild, then you will not be allowed to join 
          the new guild, until the conflict is resolved.&nbsp; A charter defines and details itself through "line items", 
          like the entrance exam, requirements to advance in rank, and requirements to hold an office.&nbsp; Any line item 
          can be an area of conflict.
         <BR><BR>
         In case you are wondering, it is not a simple matter to change a charter.&nbsp; Each member to be considered as
          part of a class, must be approved by the guild.&nbsp; This means that if a charter is changed, then you must 
          resubmit yourself for acceptance.&nbsp; If you have 'fickle' charter makers then take appropriate actions from
          within your guild.&nbsp;
          <i>From a "virtual reality environment" (VRE) point of view, your agreement is being 
          nullified, since what you agreed to in the past is no longer true.&nbsp; And from a "gaming" point of view, an
          inconsistency which could lead to unexpected "in game" consequences, possible cheating, and so on, is now
          avoided through the nullification approach.</i>

            When the game is released, you will create a new class using the "Class Constructor Screen".&nbsp; 
            You must have nine followers (players and/or NPCs) <b>and</b> a meeting place - a structure you own, a 
            rented room, or any reserved area.  You will have one year in which to buy or build your guild hall.
            <BR><BR>
            It is the "charter" which defines and details the rules of the class.  Some charter fields require data, 
            and some are optional (for role-playing or advanced play).  Currently, the only required field is the 
            entrance exam (the minimum levels of skill/experience/...).
            <BR><BR>
            An example of an <b>advanced</b> class called, "The Monks of Blue River", could be something like:
