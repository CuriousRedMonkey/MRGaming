         With the idea of open source code, will you allow players to not only invent their own items, but design them as 
          well?  Example: Wondrous Sword of Zenga (with graphics designed by me). 
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Actually, the 'open source code' forums are about using the MicroRealities APIs (Application Program Interfaces) 
         for languages like Basic, C/C++, Pascal/Delphi, and so on, not about player creation and the designing of items. 
         <BR><BR>
         Here is a little information about the forums, and then to your point about player designed items.&nbsp; These 
         'open source code' forums will become available after the release of Pravos - possibly as early as its 
         public BETA.&nbsp; The first post to the forums, will be the source code to a simple playable interface that
         enthusiasts and professionals can reprogram, make add-ons for, and learn how to write their own Interface to a 
         Vapor game.
         <BR><BR>
         Concerning item design.&nbsp; By the middle of the Alpha, you will be able to design and construct your own 
         items.&nbsp; Through persistence, you will be able to duplicate any existing items, as well as create 'totally new 
         types' of items.&nbsp; So, stoke that furnace, build those skills, and let your imagination flow into your 
         "Wondrous Sword of Zenga".&nbsp; [Note: Having your own image show up on your/friend/anyone's machine will 
         completely depend on the Interface you use, and which you share in common with others.]

         I have read about "Grand Quest" items. Can you describe these more, and any other kinds there are?

            You will have to wait until the public BETA begins before any major descriptions will be release.

                  However, a little more can be said now.&nbsp; There are three primary types of quests:

               <BR><BR>
               <DD>
                  "Grand Quests" are created by the Game Designer.&nbsp; These will 
                  lead you to "one of a kind" powerful items, of little value to you 'personally', but which propel the 
                  <b>major</b> parts of the game's story line and up-coming scenarios.
               </DD>
               <BR><BR>
               <DD>
                  "Illustrious Quests" are created by the Game Designer.&nbsp; These
                  will lead you to "one of a kind" artifacts that will drive the Pravos communities technologically (as
                  well as present new skills, introduce new approaches, award you with titles and recognition, and so on).
               </DD>
               <BR><BR>
               <DD>
                  "Character Quests" are created by "in game" characters (player and computer controlled).&nbsp; Often
                  quests of this type will reward the winner with a powerful item, but that is up to the quest creator.
                  &nbsp;Note that, "Character Quests" can be created by NPCs (Non-player Characters) which allows you 
                  an almost infinite set of "unique and game contextual" quests.&nbsp; And of course, in a Vapors game, 
                  what an NPC can do a player can do even better.&nbsp; So design your own quests for fun/intrigue/mayhem, 
                  affect the story-line/world-commerce/guild-factioning, and do other advanced things that will be 
                  discussed once the public BETA begins.

         In "Pravos", when I discover an item of great power that appears to be "one of a kind", is it?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            It depends on "who" created it.&nbsp;
            <b>All</b> items in a Vapors game are unique, even the pebble at your foot.&nbsp; However, everything made "in
             game" can always be reproduced by you - this even applies to all artifacts, with the likely exception being
             the "Grand Quest" items.
            <BR><BR>
            The way <b>you</b> will probably recognize an "artifact" will be that you have never seen anything remotely
             like its abilities/materials/constructions/etc.&nbsp; Whereas, finding an "item of great power" (which some 
             game character created) will most likely have familiar aspects for the intermediate player - but has a 
             new twist which really boosted/created a powerful item.
            <BR><BR>
            Reproducing "artifacts", which are "one of a kind" items, will just require a lot of research and creativity on 
             your part, time building new skills, and other related stuff - thus, eventually setting a new standard for 
             "powerful".

            In "Pravos", will there be restrictions on special items, such as gear that 'ties'?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>

            Yes, but not as <i>implemented</i> in previous fantasy games.
            <BR><BR>
            A scroll, from the time of "The Great Joining", reports that <i>'psychic signatures may actually 
             exist'</i>.&nbsp; No further research was done, because of the cataclysm that occurred.&nbsp; But, if this is 
             true, then there is an opportunity for you to create a whole new "in game" technology.&nbsp;
             Maybe found a new guild, which will use the <i>signatures</i> in ways never seen before, like tracking down 
             lost heirlooms for a fee, arbitrating disputes over shared alignments, and so on.&nbsp; By the way, the word
             'psychic' is probably being used generically to mean, any mental, spiritual, magical, or genetic process.
            <BR><BR>
            Note in other games, that a 'tied' item is sometimes defined as an item which is aligned to, and only to, a 
             character.&nbsp; However, in many games this definition is too restricted, and so it is often extended to a
             broader definition to include your family, alignment type, or some other definable classification.&nbsp;
             This broader definition is the one MicroRealities prefers too. 
            <BR><BR>
            As you have probably already read, <b>you</b> create the classes, skills, perceptions, and so on, 
             that implement what most other games define for you.&nbsp; This applies to weapons, armor, and any other
             game items, but more importantly it also applies to magic, psionics, prayers, or any paranormal area that 
             gets applied to game items.&nbsp; So it is 'theoretically' possible that <b>you</b> can affect the 'tie' 
             to your item, in ways very novel to the fantasy genre.

         What types of items can I expect to see in the "Pravos" game?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
            In the BETA, there will be a full spectrum of weapons (mundane through magical), armors (simple to the 
            elaborate), clothing (common through Holy), drinks (intoxicates to medicines), and so on.
            <BR><BR>
            Once the game is released, if <b>you</b> want to see an item exist, then have your character research and
            design it.&nbsp;  Obviously, you will need to practice making the item, so expect to waste a lot of the 
            required ingredients/materials during the early days, until you build your experience and skills past an
            apprenticeship level.  
            <BR><BR>
            All "tool makers", both player and computer controlled, can design and create new items for the game.

         How will super-powerful weapons be handled?  I mean, can I create a nuclear bomb and then destroy the world?
         </FONT>
      </DT>
      <DD>
         <FONT COLOR='white'>
         <P>
         Yes, it is possible.
         <BR><BR>
         Nuclear bombs are designed into the "Opsrav" game, but that is the state of their technology and 
          civilization.&nbsp;  
          They have defenses equal to the weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;
          It would take <b>you</b> decades of very focused game play, in "Pravos" and "Voraps", to produce a counter-part 
          to the nuclear bomb.&nbsp;
          But it is possible, and if that is where players in those games wish to take it then they can do it.&nbsp;
          Remember that the splitting of the atom takes tremendous resources to accomplish, and the non-science-fiction 
          worlds are not prepared for the task.
         <BR><BR>
         If a super-item (one that is far ahead of the current technology) exists then it is either a bug, part of the 
          game's initial story line, or some other community is more advanced than your community.&nbsp;
          If it is a bug, then it will be removed and appropriate actions will be taken.&nbsp;
          If it is part of the initial game's story line, then it is meant to drive game play (cultures, quests, 
          technologies, etc.) in specific ways by the game designer.&nbsp;
          The most common situation will be that some guild has been researching an area for a long time, and for awhile
          will have an advantage in the game.&nbsp;
          However, no one in any of the games gets to play by different rules than the others, which means others will 
          catch up very quickly once it is known that such-and-such can be created.
