               - An 'isometric' view of the world.  Allows the advanced player a gaming experience of complete 
                 perception, action, and control.  In addition to being a standard that many online gamers prefer, 
                 it will also ease the burden of players who control multiple groups of NPCs, need multiple 'party' 
                 windows to coordinated attacks/strategies, simplify the development and recognition of complex tactics, 
                 and so.

               - A 3D 'first person' view of the world.  Allows the beginning, or intermediate, player a gaming experience 
                 that is more natural and personal.  No previous gaming experience should be required or needed. 
                 Social oriented (non-violent) players should find this interface sufficient for their long term needs.

            <B>Long ago, a terrible magic separated &quot;The Lands of Haetu&quot; from the rest of the world.</B>

            This terrible event is referred to, in the ancient texts, as &quot;The Great Joining&quot;.&nbsp; 
            Unfortunately, not much more information is known from that time, because so much of Haetu was 
             destroyed. 
            <BR><BR> 
            Magicians know that magic can have side-effects, especially the most powerful spells.&nbsp; 
             And since it requires that practitioners join their energies to produce the most powerful magics, 
             it is reasoned that the reference to &quot;The Great Joining&quot; 
             and the surviving documents, indicate that the cataclysm occurred because of magicians. 
            <BR><BR> 
            In fact, there is a religious guild which was founded on this reasoning.&nbsp; They preach that because magic 
             was the cause of the horrible events, then the only rational solution is to turn away from magic, and 
             use prayer in its place.&nbsp;  Fortunately, they are a peaceful order, or another terrible war would 
             have decimated the lands.&nbsp; Like most religious orders, they believe they have the divine truth, and 
             so they <i>advise</i> that all Haetuans worship their god, Sejung."  +

            It is written, that immediately after &quot;The Great Joining&quot;, a mystical barrier formed around Haetu,  
             separating it from the rest of the world.&nbsp; 
            This barrier, now called the &quot;The Mist&quot;, extends farther than anyone has been able to discover.&nbsp; 
            Countless generations of explorers have lost their lives wandering in The Mist, with only the lucky finding 
             their way back. 
            <BR><BR> 
            These lucky few who have returned, are usually insane, having wandered for days in a blanket of random  
             colors and patterns.&nbsp; 
            They tell of hallucinating about long dead friends and relatives, being chased by monsters from childhood 
             nightmares, or finding their best wish fulfilled for only a moment.&nbsp; 
            They report that casting or the use of magic, does nothing.&nbsp; 
            The same for prayers, potions, runes, or any other mental or spiritual aids. 
            <BR><BR> 
            One thing is known about the few who did not go insane.&nbsp; 
            They have gone on to become the greatest heroes in history.&nbsp; 
            Which has inspired so many young adults into 'The Mist' and into oblivion.
